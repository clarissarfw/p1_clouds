		<p>Stratus clouds mean rain if it is warm and snow if it is cold. They look like a huge gray blanket that hangs low in the sky. Sometimes stratus clouds are on the ground or very near the ground, and then we call them fog.

		If you look at the sky on a gray day, you won't see much definition in the clouds, but if you fly above them, you'll see that they do have discernible shapes The layer closest to the ground is full of moisture, and the air at the ground may even be misty. That bottom layer usually obscures the shapes of the clouds themselves, but occasionally the mist clears and you can see the clouds. They are generally dense, heavy and large. A single cloud can stretch from horizon to horizon. Because they are so dense, they do a good job of blocking sunlight, so the bottom layer of the clouds – behind the mist – is generally very dark.</p>
